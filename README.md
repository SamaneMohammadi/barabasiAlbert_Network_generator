# barabasiAlbert_Network_generator
Scale-free graph generator using the preferential attachment rule as defined in the Barabási-Albert model.

This is a very simple graph generator that generates a graph using the preferential attachment rule defined in the Barabási-Albert model: nodes are generated one by one, and each time attached by one or more edges other nodes. The other nodes are chosen using a biased random selection giving more chance to a node if it has a high degree.
